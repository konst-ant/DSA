This repo collects up various code & tasks on DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms).

This is not in a way exhaustive or substitute for fundamental books on DSA.
However, it has some interesting and useful code & tasks which were accumulated on long run from:

- DSA books follow-up coding
- Codility & Leetcode
- Past sessions where I was interviewed
- Past sessions where I interviewed
- Miscellaneous
